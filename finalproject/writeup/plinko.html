<h1>Simple Plinko</h1>
<img src="overview.png" alt="Plinko game in action"/>
<p>
Simple plinko is a very (very (very (very))) simple implementation of the 
popular game "Plinko" from The Price is Right.  If you haven't seen it, take
a look at 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYmXRbkM8tw&amp;feature=fvw">this video</a>
starting at about one minute.
</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The basic premise is simple.  A number of flat discs are dropped onto a large
board covered in small pegs.  The disc bounces off these pegs as it drops
down towards the bottom of the board.  The bottom of the board catches the discs
and different scores are assigned based on the location that the disc lands.
</p>

<p>
The player is given 4 game discs to try and score maximum points. Once released,
the disc cannot be grabbed again.
</p>

<h2>How to play</h2>

<p>
At the beginning of play, the four discs are stationary to the right of the
game board.
</p>

<p>
Game control is through the mouse. Drag any of the four plinko discs to the 
area above the game board.  Release the disc and it will begin falling to the 
bottom of the board.  Reset the game with the "r" key.

<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>
My goals for the Plinko game were as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Implement an OpenGL application with Python</li>
<li>Implement a simple collision detection system</li>
<li>Implement a simple gravity simulator</li>
</ul>

<h3>Python</h3>
<p>
Implenting the project in Python posed several challenges.  For one, there is
significantly less literature about coding OpenGL applications in Python.
Fortunately, the majority of the PyOpenGL calls are simple wrappers around
the C calls, and those that aren't follow a reasonable standard of multiple 
return values translated to Tuples.
</p>

<p>
For example, the OpenGL call <strong>glScalef</strong> is unchanged in
PyOpenGL, while the OpenGL call <strong>gluUnProject</strong> is changed 
significantly.  In C, this function takes nine parameters.  Three doubles to
represent the window coordinates, pointers to the model, projection and view 
matrixes,
and three pointers to doubles to store the resulting world coordinates. In
PyOpenGL, this function takes three floating point numbers to represent
the window coordinates, and returns a Tuple containing the world coordinates.
The three matrices are optional (they are filled in for you if not defined).
</p>

<h3>Collision Detection</h3>
<p>
The collision detection system proved simple.  Because the pegs and discs are 
both cylinders and they exist within the same Z plane, I can use the sphere 
collision algorithm to determine if they collide.  The walls are similarly easy,
as they use the same collision algorithm, but the range of collisions is much
higher.
</p>

<h3>Gravity Simulator</h3>
<p>
The gravity simulator was also fairly easy, but getting to not look choppy and
erratic took some patience.  Eventually I settled on a constant downward force
applied every frame, and a velocity reduction after each collision (so that 
collisions wouldn't be perfectly elastic) that results in the disc moving
inexhorably towards the bottom, but the final X coordinate of the disc is 
not obvious.
</p>

<h2>Resources Used</h2>
<p>
To implement moving object around in a Perspective projection, I used a couple
of functions (<strong>gluUnProject</strong>  and <strong>gluProject</strong>) to
handle the finer aspects of converting from window to world coordinates and 
back.  These functions aren't very well documented, but 
<a href="http://sites.google.com/site/vamsikrishnav/gluunproject">this site</a>
was rather helpful in deciphering them.
</p>

General PyOpenGL notes can be found at 
<a href="http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/documentation/">

</p>

<h2>Executable and Source Code</h2>
<p>
I can't provide executable code.  
</p>
<p>
Well...I could but I'm far too lazy to figure out the finer aspects of compiling
python to executable code.  But there is good news for you folks looking to 
execute my code.  I have every intention of putting the code for this project
into a public repository somewhere.  You're welcome to track it down, but 
remember Cal Poly's rules regarding cheating.
