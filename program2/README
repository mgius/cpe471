Translation is managed by the right mouse button.  Click and drag the right
 mouse button anywhere to move the cube. You don't have to be on the cube to
 click it

Rotation is managed by the left mouse button.  The "trackball" is centered in
 the window, even if the cube is translated to another location.  When the
 mouse is "outside" the trackball, the cube is rotated purely around the z
 axis.  The trackball maintains its scale, so a very wide window will have
 a comparatively small trackball.

Scaling is managed by the middle mouse button.  Slide the mouse to the right
 to scale up, slide the mouse to the left to scale down. There are bounds on 
 the scale.

"m" to switch cube modes, "r" to reset
