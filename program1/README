Shapes available are Circle, square, bars, line, and strokes

Bars are a large = sign, centered at the mouse click.

Line allows you to select two points and draw a line between those two points.
Colors are sampled at the two points.

Strokes creates a line from your mouse to a point off the right of the window.
This doesn't work so well for individual strokes, but it has an interesting
effect when used to backfill.

"Sample from Image" fulfills project requirement.  "sample once from image" 
turns the next mouseclick into a color grab, then leaves that color, no matter
where you stroke.

Backfill and Backfill sparse use different pixel jumps.

Press "c" to clear the canvas.

I'm aware that my "stroke" implementation is a little on the odd side.  It 
allows me to do my two-stroke line implementation very cleanly, and in some 
cases could improve performance significantly (especially if the function call 
cost is very high) by grouping similar strokes so that they can be drawn in a
single call to "draw."
